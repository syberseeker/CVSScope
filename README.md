# Fast Vuln Scanner

This is my first hobby project to demonstrate the basic vulnerability scanner using python-nmap module. This simple tool will perform the fast scan by entering the target IP and the result can be export in the CSV format.


# Installation

- ***pip install python-nmap***
- ***pip install tabulate***
- ***pip install colorama***
- ***pip install signal***

# How to Use

- Just run ***python fv_scanner.py***

# Version

v1.0 (2024-02-28)
- Adding in Script vulners
- Displaying the scan result in a table format
- Ability to export the scan result in the CSV format

# Next Roadmap

- Adding capability to perform scanning based on target IP range
- Adding capability to evade firewall / IDS detection during scan process
